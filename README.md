# devconnector
A social media for developers, where you're able to connect to other users and share your experiences with multiple technologies. This was my first ever Node.js and React.js project.

## Funcionalities
* Create your account to connect to other users
* Import your github projects and repos to use as a portfolio
* Create posts on a global timeline, where all users (including yourself) are able to like and comment
* Visit other users' profiles
